In this project I have designed a dual trailing edge phase dimmer using a Triac as the main switching component.

Originally the device hosted a webpage which was accessible on the LAN that it was connected to, but this was a bit annoying because I had to open a browser and wait for the web page to load every time I wanted to change the state of the device. I then discovered the MQTT protocol and Node-Red. check them out if you have not heard of them.

MQTT is basically a light weight communication protocol which is great for microcontrollers.

Node-Red is a flow-based development tool which is also great for home automation, you can interface almost anything to it, most notably MQTT and Home bridge.

Home bridge allows you to create custom devices that will show up in the iOS/Mac OS Homekit app, this is how I ended up controlling this device. In Homekit the device shows up as 2 dimmable light bulbs.

Node-Red also allows you to interface a Telegram bot. So, you can control almost anything in your home via the bot, for example if some over current/temperature is detected in the light dimmer, Node-Red can send me a message via telegram notifying me.

This device has 3 microcontrollers.

1. An ESP8266 which handles the WiFi communication such as connecting to a Wifi Network, connecting MQTT server and sending/receiving data to and from that server.
2. An Arduino Nano considered as the "Sensor" controller. It collects all the recorded temperatures in the Light Dimmer, it also captures the consumed current of the device and pushes these values to the ESP8266.
3.  Another Arduino Nano considered as the "Triac" controller. It receives a Zero-Cross signal and then calculates the trigger times for each Triac based of the desired power.

All 3 controllers are interconnected via I2C.

The block diagram below describes the main interconnections in the device.

## uController PCB
Here we can view the uController PCB that connects all 3 micro-controllers

This board has the following

- ESP8266
- 2x Arduino Nanos
- 4 LED connectors
- Connector to the Power Control PCB
- Connector to the Triac PCB
- 12[V] connector
- A buck PSU which supplyâ€™s a 5[V] from 12[V], originally there was a 7805 but after a few months of running it I discovered that it got hot. I had a choice between adding a head sink or put a buck converter in place of the LDO. The buck converter seemed like a better idea since there would be not heat. Luckily there was enough space to mount it on the board.

## Triac PCB

Here we can view the Triac PCB mounted to the enclosure, the uController PCB is also visible.

This board consists of the High and Low Voltage side, where the high voltage side has 220VAC that will be cut by the Triacs and the low voltage side has optocouplers which trigger those Triacs.

The circuit is quite basic and a full description can be found [here](http://www.soloelectronica.net/PDF/moc3020.pdf) and a super basic diagram can be found [here](http://www.soloelectronica.net/PDF/moc3020.pdf)

This board has the following

- 2x Triac Circuits with RC snubbers and MOVs for voltage spikes
- A low voltage connector suppling a 5[V] rail, Ground, One-Wire and 2 Trigger lines for the optocouplers, this connector goes to the uController PCB.
- A high voltage connector that has 220[VAC] input and the return chopped sinewave. This connector goes to the Power Control PCB.

These photos were taken while I was assembling the device, that is why some components are missing.

## Power Control PCB
Here we can view the Power Control PCB.

To the top left you can see the switch mode PSU that provides the 12[V] rail for the system

To the top right you can see an EMI filter.

And lastly at the bottom of the encloser you can see the Power Control Board.

The Power control PCB holds the following

- Control Relays that will completely disconnect the Live and Neutral when the output is off.
- an ACS712 for current sensing
- 2 pairs of inductors for current limiting.
- Zero cross detection circuit
- Fuses on the Live and Neutral lines

Here I was fitting the heatsinks to the board, the two outer screws hold the heatsink to the board, the one inner screw has a threaded hole and couples the Triac to the heatsink.

## Pictures and Descriptions

Here we can see the dimmer interface with a website hosted on the ESP.
The website is very responsive, and the values were updated via a WebSocket, therefore the web page did not have to refesh in order to get new data. But loading the website took a few seconds which was quite annoying

Here I was testing the trigger signals for the Triac vs the Zero Cross Signal

Here is the complete unit although the yemperature sensors have not yet been installed

Here is a basic demonstration of the dimmer turning a single bulb on and off.
Note the "soft start" of the bulb, theoretically this can dramatically increase the life span of the bulbs.

## Notes

1. The Inductors L1, L2, L3 and L4 do not have enough inductance to fully suppress the inrush current of the Bulbs. I did no math when implementing these inductors. I simply bought the biggest inductors that were available at my local electronics store. I would recommend finding an inductor with a value closer to 1[H] with a current rating of 6[A] minimum.

2. The Inductors L1 and L3, L2 and L4 are in parallel, which reduces the current between the inductors by half, this was done to reduce the amount of heat that each inductor would emit but, doing so reduces the inductance by half.

3. The temperature sensors are interfaced with a One-Wire Interface. With 6 of these sensors a lot of electrical noise is generated when communicating with them. This noise is somehow propagated to the cut sinusoid and an audible ringing noise is apparent, which emits from the bulbs. I have not investigated ways to emit, or evening reduce this "electrical/ audible" noise. But maybe reducing the clock speed of the One-Wire bus could help. After speaking to a Professor about this issue, he mentioned that my track layout on the PCB is most likely the issue. If I create another revision of this project I would most likely change the temperature sensors to some thermocouples or thermistors and have a multiplexor and opamp to measure the temperatures. 

4. Implementing 3 uControllers is defiantly over kill but it makes things much easier when programing these devices. If I would put everything onto the ESP8266 it would be more challenging to code since I would have to think about all the different types of interrupts that would occur when dealing with the Wifi, Triacs, Zero-Crossing, One-Wire, etc. The Wifi library is a huge black box that just works. I did not want to spend time diving into the Wifi library to see how I could make things more efficient.

5. Almost all these components (encloser, heatsinks, relays, EMI filter, PSU) were purchased from gme.cz 

6. The ESP8266 comes in different sizes, if you do plan to fabricate the PCBs ensure you buy the correct ESP8266 board.

7. The Code provided requires a MQTT server on the LAN it connects to, in the WiFi_code you can find the topics which the board will be publishing and subscribed to.
